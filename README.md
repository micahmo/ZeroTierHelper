# ZeroTierHelper
A Windows thick client for managing ZeroTier networks and members.

This is a simple Windows Forms app which interacts with the ZeroTier public API via the user's API key.
It retrieves data about networks and members, and allows the user to initiate RDP, File Share, or Ping to the remote IP via a ZeroTier network.
