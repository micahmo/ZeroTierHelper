# ZeroTierHelper
A Windows thick client for managing ZeroTier networks and members.

This is a simple Windows Forms app which interacts with the ZeroTier public API via the user's API key.
It retrieves data about networks and members, and allows the user to initiate RDP, File Share, or Ping to the remote IP via a ZeroTier network.

* Add some assets (icon)

# Long-Term TODO
* Allow management (i.e., editing network and member objects) via the client
